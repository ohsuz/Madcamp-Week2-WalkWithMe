### :one: My Page
> This is the first page you'll see if you successfully log in. The picture in the middle is the main screen.
You can check your past walking information(total number of walks, total distance, etc.) and see a list of your friends you've made in this app.
If you click your profile image, you can see your past walking routes, and if you click the trophy image, you can see the leaderboard made up of only you and your friends. 
This will further increase your enthusiasm for walking:fire:

> If you click the "+" button, you can see a list of people in your phone book who are members of our app but are not yet friends with you in this app.
If you want to be friends with any of them, you can add friends by clicking on their ID.

### :two: Best Walking Routes

> Here are some good walking routes near KAIST we've found. Currently, there are two types of routes: easy and hard. An easy route is one with a slope of less than 12 meters and a hard route is a slope of more than 12 meters. 
Pressing the floating action button, you can see each type of route individually.

### :three: Walk With Me
> This is the core function of our app. If you select the preferred route among the available walk routes, the path is displayed on the map. You can enjoy your walk while following the map.
<div>
<img width="30%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59340911/91103978-bf33ee80-e6a7-11ea-957a-f3a202786a9c.jpg">

</div><br>

> When you're done, you have to press the stop sign and the finish button one by one. Then, the walking information and the snapshot of the walk will be stored on the server.
As you saw in [the first section](#one-my-page), you can check your past walking routes by clicking on your profile image. 
Anyway, you will no longer feel lonely while taking a walk alone on campus! Because now you walk with **"Walk With Me"**:blue_heart:
